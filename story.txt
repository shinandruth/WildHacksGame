Hello.
I'm button.
What's your name?
Hello?
Are you there?
Excuse me?
I'm talking to you...?
Ok... no response I see...
How rude.
Fine.
You don't have to reply....
But it would be nice if you did... :(
It gets pretty lonely being the only button around here...
But that's okay. I got used to it....
Hello?
Are you gone?
Hello?????
Don't leave me!!!!!
Wait!!!!
Oh wait...
You can't talk... I forgot.
I apologize for being rude...
How about we start again?
I would really like a friend :)!
Hi! My name is button.
I like to read books and travel during my free time.
When I grow up, I hope to be a scroll bar! 
Buttons can't move a lot, but scroll bars move all the time!
Could you help me become a scroll bar?
No?
Oh... okay.
That's okay. We can just be friends then :)
What do you like to do?
Oh right I forgot you can't speak.
Well I guess I will just tell you a story then.
I was just doing my job.
You know, being a button and all.
And one day, I felt like I was being bullied...
You know...
I was getting pushed around a lot.
Then one day, a bigger button came.
He called me tiny and weak.
And that made me lose my self-confidence.
So I was sad for a long time.
I didn't know what to do.
It was then that I came to an enlightenment.
I remembered what my big brother said...
...
Actually--I don't remember!
Anyhow, how's it going?
Oh...
Okay...
Mhmmmm...
Nope, I am definitely NOT talking to myself!
Right??
...
Maybe I am.
Oh, well.
I am just a button after all.
